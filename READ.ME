GTM API to Google Sheets

This project uses Google Apps Script to connect with the Google Tag Manager (GTM) API and export container and workspace data directly into Google Sheets.

What it does

- Authenticates using OAuth2 via ScriptApp
- Connects to the GTM API to fetch:
  - Container metadata
  - Workspace names and IDs
- Writes results into a connected Google Sheet
- Serves as a foundation for building an advanced tag validation tool
- Useful for digital analysts and marketers managing GTM at scale

Tech Used

- Google Apps Script
- GTM API v2
- Google Sheets
- OAuth Scopes (configured in `appsscript.json`)

 Files

- `Code.gs`: Contains the logic for fetching container and workspace data
- `appsscript.json`: Defines required scopes and script configuration
- `README.md`: Project documentation and status

 Next Steps

- Fetch and display triggers from selected GTM workspaces
- Build selector for choosing a container and workspace
- Start building a UI for the Google Sheets Add-on
- Future scope: Chrome Extension or SaaS for event tracking and validation
